# Local Notes

Working notes, investigation logs, and scratch scripts from various Pydantic AI development sessions. These are kept for reference but are not polished documentation.

**Not intended to be useful to others** - just a historical record of debugging sessions, test scripts, and workflow notes that occasionally come in handy.

Contents include:
- Bug investigation notes (Prefect hangs, VCR cache issues)
- One-off test/debug scripts
- Utility scripts for snapshot normalization
- Workflow documentation drafts
